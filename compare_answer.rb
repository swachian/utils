# * Write a script to compare two answers.  -- compare_answer.rb
# The first one is stardard followed by an answer file. 
# Only the characters in the files make sense. Others will be just ignored.
# Example: 
    # ruby compare_answer.rb stard.txt own.txt
    # => 'same: 55, disparities: 20'

# Examples
# CompareAnswer.compare(ARGV[0], ARGV[1])
# # => 'same: 55, disparities: 20'
