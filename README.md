2012.6.1  compare_answer.rb 
Some script to assistant my business   
* Write a script to compare two answers.  
  The first one is stardard followed by an answer file.   
  Only the characters in the files make sense. Others will be just ignored.  
  Example:   
  		ruby compare_answer.rb compare_answer_fixtures/stardard_answer.txt compare_answer_fixtures/own_answer.txt  
        # => 'same: 55, disparities: 20'  

2012.6.2 试用nodejs, 用coffeescript写一个http server.  
  - httpserver.coffee  
  很简单也很自然, 越来越喜欢coffee了  
  而且加入callback并不影响链式调用与定义. Great!
