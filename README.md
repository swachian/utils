Some script to assistant my business   
* Write a script to compare two answers.  -- compare_answer.rb  
  The first one is stardard followed by an answer file.   
  Only the characters in the files make sense. Others will be just ignored.  
  Example:   
  		ruby compare_answer.rb compare_answer_fixtures/stardard_answer.txt compare_answer_fixtures/own_answer.txt  
        # => 'same: 55, disparities: 20'
